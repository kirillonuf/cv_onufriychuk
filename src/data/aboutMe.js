I am looking for a long-term job as a Junior Front-end Developer in a modern and fast-growing company.
Now I am finishing a front-end developer course at the «STEP» IT Academy, where I received experience in
creating websites. During training on the courses, I implemented test tasks and projects, which can be
viewed on Github at the link below.
I would like to apply this knowledge on real projects and develop as a developer with the main technology
stack React.js/Node.js. Ready to explore a lot of information and new technologies.
I consider formats: full time, remote work, office work.`;
